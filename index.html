        <h2>Missile Man Of India</h2>
        <p><b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR 15 October 1931  27 July 2015)</b> was an Indian aerospace 
           scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. Born and 
           raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he studied physics and aerospace engineering.
           He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence
           Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was 
           intimately involved in India's civilianspace programme and military missile development efforts. He 
           thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile
            and launch vehicle technology.He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in
             India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
